Seeker for frame by frame in your video using this app

![][project-banner]

<div>

  ## Introdution
  A frame seeker app was one my first applications using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS languages - the initial purpose of this application was to create a YouTube video seeker using [`Canvas API`][canvas-api] and [`requestAnimationFrame`][requestanimationframe] to extract frame by frame and render it when hovering a progress bar, and this was concluded - but now the project was recreated using React and Tailwind and a clearer visual.
